# Deviations from SillyTavern — the browser half

Where the interface and the card sandbox deliberately do something other than
what SillyTavern does, and what each difference was measured to cost. A deviation
with no measurement is a guess, so every entry names what it read and **what
would overturn it**.

The host keeps its own ledger at `packages/iris-app-service/DEVIATIONS.md`; this
one covers `apps/iris-web` — the shell, the frames, and the card-facing surface
inside them. Render-pipeline differences that need their surrounding argument are
worked out in `RENDER.md` and referenced from here rather than restated.

Two kinds of entry, and the difference matters more than the list:

- A **compatibility gap** is a place Iris is worse than upstream and intends to
  stop being. It carries what closing it would take.
- A **deliberate improvement** is a place Iris is different on purpose. It
  carries what it costs, because an improvement with no cost recorded is usually
  an unexamined preference.

## 1. An unbuilt member on the card surface yields `undefined` and is reported

**Kind:** deliberate improvement.

**Upstream.** Reading an absent property on `SillyTavern` — or on any object —
returns `undefined` and says nothing. That is not a SillyTavern decision, it is
JavaScript's, and every card is written against it.

**Iris** returns `undefined` too, and additionally reports the member by name
once, through the durable card-report channel. The virtual `parent` proxy has
worked this way since an earlier round; the `SillyTavern` surface was brought
into line with it, having previously thrown.

**Why the throw was wrong**, and why this is not merely a preference: every
measured `SillyTavern` access in the corpus sits behind a guard, and both guard
styles in use are defeated by a throwing getter.

| guard style | sites | what a throw does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `if (ctx && ctx.eventSource && ctx.event_types)` | 18 | throws at the read |
| `if (typeof ctx.setExtensionPrompt === 'function')` | 4 | throws at the read |

`typeof` does not help: it guards an undeclared **identifier**, never a missing
**property**, and `typeof obj.x` still evaluates `obj.x`. The guard triggers the
thing it exists to prevent. The identical failure had already been paid for once
on the `parent` proxy, where throwing on a read-with-default broke upstream's
cross-script coordination inside an init that swallows exceptions.

**What it costs.** A misspelled member is now a silent `undefined` at the call
site instead of a named exception. The report is what buys that back, so the
report is not decoration — if it is ever made conditional or dropped, this entry
becomes a plain compatibility hazard.

**What would overturn it.** A measurement showing cards that rely on a throw to
detect absence — none does today; the corpus's habit is the opposite.

## 2. `chatMetadata` is not replaced when the snapshot refreshes

**Kind:** deliberate improvement, forced by a difference Iris cannot remove.

**Upstream.** `saveMetadata()` takes no argument. The idiom, and the one corpus
caller follows it exactly, is: mutate `chatMetadata` in place, then ask for it to
be saved. Upstream can do that because its metadata object is live and in the
same realm as the card.

**Iris** hands a card a snapshot across an origin boundary, and refreshes that
snapshot on every event that settles the chat. Everything in it is replaced
wholesale **except `chatMetadata`**, which the frame keeps for its lifetime.

**Why.** Without the exemption, any reply settling anywhere in the chat between a
card writing a key and calling `saveMetadata` swaps the object out from under it.
The save then proceeds, reports success, and stores the version without the
write. The window is not instantaneous: the corpus's caller saves on a 2000ms
debounce that every further write resets, so under continuous use it stays open
indefinitely, and what is lost is every write since the last save.

**What it costs.** A stale read — a metadata change made outside this frame does
not reach a card already running. That is visible and reversible; a discarded
write is neither, and disguises itself as success. No measured card reads
metadata it did not itself write.

**Guarded by** `sandbox-frame.test.ts`, in a pair: one test that the edit
survives, and one that **everything else still refreshes**. The second exists
because the cheapest way to stop a refresh discarding writes is to stop
refreshing, which would satisfy the first test perfectly while silently undoing
the live-snapshot work.

**What would overturn it.** A card that reads metadata written elsewhere, or a
host-side channel that lets the frame merge remote changes without clobbering
local ones.

## 3. `getCharWorldbookNames` serves only `'current'`

**Kind:** compatibility gap, scoped by measurement.

**Upstream.** `getCharWorldbookNames(character_name)` is **synchronous** and
accepts `'current'` or a character name. A named lookup matches
case-insensitively against both the character's name and its avatar filename, and
throws when nothing matches; `'current'` with no character selected returns an
empty result rather than throwing.

**Iris** answers `'current'` from the pushed snapshot's `charWorldbooks`, and
refuses any other argument by name.

**Why.** The synchrony is the constraint. All five corpus call sites read a
property straight off the result — `getCharWorldbookNames('current').primary` —
and two of the three cards have no guard on the value that flows onward into
`getWorldbook`. A promise-returning façade would hand those cards `undefined`
silently. Serving the named branch would require the snapshot to carry every
character's bindings, which is unbounded.

**Measured, not inferred:** 5 of 5 call sites pass `'current'`. The named branch
is the one no card travels — which is the reverse of what this looked like before
it was measured.

**What it costs.** A card asking for a named character gets a refusal naming the
member. That is worse than upstream and better than `undefined`.

**What would overturn it.** A card in the corpus passing a character name, or a
host-side synchronous read that makes the named branch answerable.

## 4. A card interface has no storage at all

**Kind:** compatibility gap, and one that cannot be closed the obvious way.

**Upstream.** Message iframes carry **no `sandbox` attribute** and are therefore
same-origin, so a card interface can use `localStorage` and IndexedDB.

**Iris** renders them in an opaque origin. Measured, not assumed: `localStorage`
**throws** on access, and `indexedDB.open` throws as well — the throwing variant,
not the hang some references describe.

**What it costs.** Concretely, the sample card's settings pane writes its API
configuration to `localStorage`, so under Iris it starts blank every time.

**Why it cannot be closed by adding `allow-same-origin`:** that flag *is* the
wall. Closing it properly means the shell offering a storage channel over the
bridge that already exists and cards opting into it — separate work, not an
oversight in the render pipeline. See `RENDER.md`, "What this does not do".

**What would overturn it.** Nothing about the measurement; only the work.
