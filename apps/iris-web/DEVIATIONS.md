# Deviations from SillyTavern — the browser half

Where the interface and the card sandbox deliberately do something other than
what SillyTavern does, and what each difference was measured to cost. A deviation
with no measurement is a guess, so every entry names what it read and **what
would overturn it**.

The host keeps its own ledger at `packages/iris-app-service/DEVIATIONS.md`; this
one covers `apps/iris-web` — the shell, the frames, and the card-facing surface
inside them. Render-pipeline differences that need their surrounding argument are
worked out in `RENDER.md` and referenced from here rather than restated.

Two kinds of entry, and the difference matters more than the list:

- A **compatibility gap** is a place Iris is worse than upstream and intends to
  stop being. It carries what closing it would take.
- A **deliberate improvement** is a place Iris is different on purpose. It
  carries what it costs, because an improvement with no cost recorded is usually
  an unexamined preference.

## 1. An unbuilt member on the card surface yields `undefined` and is reported

**Kind:** deliberate improvement.

**Upstream.** Reading an absent property on `SillyTavern` — or on any object —
returns `undefined` and says nothing. That is not a SillyTavern decision, it is
JavaScript's, and every card is written against it.

**Iris** returns `undefined` too, and additionally reports the member by name
once, through the durable card-report channel. The virtual `parent` proxy has
worked this way since an earlier round; the `SillyTavern` surface was brought
into line with it, having previously thrown.

**Why the throw was wrong**, and why this is not merely a preference: every
measured `SillyTavern` access in the corpus sits behind a guard, and both guard
styles in use are defeated by a throwing getter.

| guard style | sites | what a throw does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `if (ctx && ctx.eventSource && ctx.event_types)` | 18 | throws at the read |
| `if (typeof ctx.setExtensionPrompt === 'function')` | 4 | throws at the read |

`typeof` does not help: it guards an undeclared **identifier**, never a missing
**property**, and `typeof obj.x` still evaluates `obj.x`. The guard triggers the
thing it exists to prevent. The identical failure had already been paid for once
on the `parent` proxy, where throwing on a read-with-default broke upstream's
cross-script coordination inside an init that swallows exceptions.

**What it costs.** A misspelled member is now a silent `undefined` at the call
site instead of a named exception. The report is what buys that back, so the
report is not decoration — if it is ever made conditional or dropped, this entry
becomes a plain compatibility hazard.

**What would overturn it.** A measurement showing cards that rely on a throw to
detect absence — none does today; the corpus's habit is the opposite.

## 2. `chatMetadata` is not replaced when the snapshot refreshes

**Kind:** deliberate improvement, forced by a difference Iris cannot remove.

**Upstream.** `saveMetadata()` takes no argument. The idiom, and the one corpus
caller follows it exactly, is: mutate `chatMetadata` in place, then ask for it to
be saved. Upstream can do that because its metadata object is live and in the
same realm as the card.

**Iris** hands a card a snapshot across an origin boundary, and refreshes that
snapshot on every event that settles the chat. Everything in it is replaced
wholesale **except `chatMetadata`**, which the frame keeps for its lifetime.

**Why.** Without the exemption, any reply settling anywhere in the chat between a
card writing a key and calling `saveMetadata` swaps the object out from under it.
The save then proceeds, reports success, and stores the version without the
write. The window is not instantaneous: the corpus's caller saves on a 2000ms
debounce that every further write resets, so under continuous use it stays open
indefinitely, and what is lost is every write since the last save.

**What it costs.** A stale read — a metadata change made outside this frame does
not reach a card already running. That is visible and reversible; a discarded
write is neither, and disguises itself as success. No measured card reads
metadata it did not itself write.

**Guarded by** `sandbox-frame.test.ts`, in a pair: one test that the edit
survives, and one that **everything else still refreshes**. The second exists
because the cheapest way to stop a refresh discarding writes is to stop
refreshing, which would satisfy the first test perfectly while silently undoing
the live-snapshot work.

**What would overturn it.** A card that reads metadata written elsewhere, or a
host-side channel that lets the frame merge remote changes without clobbering
local ones.

## 3. `getCharWorldbookNames` serves only `'current'`

**Kind:** compatibility gap, scoped by measurement.

**Upstream.** `getCharWorldbookNames(character_name)` is **synchronous** and
accepts `'current'` or a character name. A named lookup matches
case-insensitively against both the character's name and its avatar filename, and
throws when nothing matches; `'current'` with no character selected returns an
empty result rather than throwing.

**Iris** answers `'current'` from the pushed snapshot's `charWorldbooks`, and
refuses any other argument by name.

**Why.** The synchrony is the constraint. All five corpus call sites read a
property straight off the result — `getCharWorldbookNames('current').primary` —
and two of the three cards have no guard on the value that flows onward into
`getWorldbook`. A promise-returning façade would hand those cards `undefined`
silently. Serving the named branch would require the snapshot to carry every
character's bindings, which is unbounded.

**Measured, not inferred:** 5 of 5 call sites pass `'current'`. The named branch
is the one no card travels — which is the reverse of what this looked like before
it was measured.

**What it costs.** A card asking for a named character gets a refusal naming the
member. That is worse than upstream and better than `undefined`.

**What would overturn it.** A card in the corpus passing a character name, or a
host-side synchronous read that makes the named branch answerable.

## 4. A card interface has no storage at all

**Kind:** compatibility gap, and one that cannot be closed the obvious way.

**Upstream.** Message iframes carry **no `sandbox` attribute** and are therefore
same-origin, so a card interface can use `localStorage` and IndexedDB.

**Iris** renders them in an opaque origin. Measured, not assumed: `localStorage`
**throws** on access, and `indexedDB.open` throws as well — the throwing variant,
not the hang some references describe.

**What it costs.** Concretely, the sample card's settings pane writes its API
configuration to `localStorage`, so under Iris it starts blank every time.

**Why it cannot be closed by adding `allow-same-origin`:** that flag *is* the
wall. Closing it properly means the shell offering a storage channel over the
bridge that already exists and cards opting into it — separate work, not an
oversight in the render pipeline. See `RENDER.md`, "What this does not do".

**What would overturn it.** Nothing about the measurement; only the work.

## 5. Live objects: two surfaces, opposite rules

**Kind:** compatibility gap on one surface, faithful behaviour on the other. They
are recorded together because the same measurement produced both answers, and
reading either alone gets the other backwards.

An audit of what the frame hands a card, measured by mutating each return value
and re-reading it — one fresh realm per probe, for the reason in `METHODS.md`:

| accessor | hands the card |
| --- | --- |
| `getVariables({type})` | live |
| `getAllVariables()` | copy (the merge builds a new object) |
| `SillyTavern.chat` | live |
| `SillyTavern.characters` | live |
| `getChatMessages()` | a new array of **live** message objects |
| `getSwipes()` | live |
| `SillyTavern.chatMetadata` | live |

"Live" is not one verdict, because the two surfaces have opposite upstream rules.

### The SillyTavern context surface: live is correct

`chat` (63 accesses), `chatMetadata` (57), `extensionSettings` (15) and
`characters` (6) are SillyTavern's own objects, and upstream hands them over
live. Cards mutate them and that is the documented idiom. **Here the gap is not
that we hand out a live object — it is that our live object is a snapshot, so the
mutation never reaches the host.** Each of the three that cards actually write is
handled separately and none of the fixes is "stop handing out a live object":

- `chat` — recorded and replayed (`CHAT-WRITES.md`, entry in progress)
- `chatMetadata` — carried across refreshes (§2)
- `extensionSettings` — a proxy that posts each write (already worked, and the
  precedent the others were designed against). **Shallow**: a nested write is not
  intercepted, which is the same element-level blind spot the chat journal wraps
  message objects to avoid.

### The Tavern Helper surface: live is a divergence

Upstream TH's house rule is the opposite — it clones on the way out, 21 `klona`
calls across 10 modules, `getVariables` / `getChatMessages` / `getPreset` /
`getCharacter` among them. So a card mutating a TH return value changes nothing
on real SillyTavern, and changes our snapshot here.

That makes our liveness **Iris-only behaviour**: a card doing this works in Iris
and silently does nothing upstream — the worse direction, because it invites
cards to depend on something no other host provides. Corpus mutations of TH
return values: **zero**, so cloning breaks nothing measured.

**Fix:** clone at the façade's exit, once, rather than per accessor — a per-member
`klona` makes "the new member forgot to clone" a regression that can happen,
where a single exit makes it impossible. Ordered after the shape fix in §6,
because cloning an object whose field names are wrong accomplishes nothing.

**Unclassified:** `groups`. The census pattern that produced this table looks for
mutation, not rebinding, so a member that is only ever reassigned reads as
untouched. Absence of evidence here is not evidence — recorded as unknown rather
than as safe.

**What would overturn it.** A corpus card mutating a TH return value, which would
mean upstream's clone is load-bearing for it and our liveness was masking a bug.

## 6. `getChatMessages` returns SillyTavern's shape, not Tavern Helper's

**Kind:** compatibility gap. Live, and the most consequential one open.

**Upstream** (`chat_message.ts:164`) returns a **renamed** object:

```
{ message_id, name, role, is_hidden, message, data, extra,
  swipe_id, swipes, swipes_data }
```

**Iris** returns `ScriptChatMessage` — SillyTavern's storage shape: `mes`,
`is_user`, `is_system`, `swipes`. So a card reading `.message`, `.role`,
`.is_hidden` or `.message_id` gets `undefined`.

**How it happened**, because the mechanism matters more than the fault:
`ScriptChatMessage`'s field names rest on a real measurement — 194 `context.chat`
accesses across the corpus read `mes`, `is_user`, `swipes`. That measurement is
correct, and it is about `context.chat`, which *is* SillyTavern's own array.
`TavernHelper.getChatMessages()` is a different surface, where upstream renames.
**A sound measurement of one surface was applied one notch beyond its range.**

The divergence needed no upstream access to establish: this repo already contains
the TH shape, in `packages/iris-compat-tavernhelper/src/chat-messages.ts`. Two
implementations of one member, in one repo, disagreeing.

**The `data` field is half of a larger gap.** It is annotated *"where MVU keeps
`stat_data`"*, and Iris's shape has no such field. The other route to floor
variables — `getVariables({type:'message', message_id})` — is refused by name.
So both paths are closed: one loudly, one silently. They were treated as two
items for some time; they are one picture, and MVU loading successfully says
nothing about whether it can read floor state.

**What would overturn it.** Nothing — the shape is settled. What is still being
measured is *which* fields the corpus's fourteen call sites read, which decides
how many cards are silently receiving `undefined` today and whether `data` is on
a live read path.

## 7. `getSwipes` and `swipeTo` are Iris's own members

**Kind:** deliberate improvement.

**Upstream** has no member of either name — confirmed against its `@types` and
its `src`, both zero hits. Swipes are reached through the message that carries
them.

**Iris** makes a swipe a first-class object, so there is a name to call and no
upstream spelling to copy.

**Why this is recorded rather than left as an implementation detail.** The
provenance lived only in a test comment. `identity.test.ts` holds an `IRIS_OWN`
allowlist with a paired guard — any name in it that upstream *does* have fails —
so the fact is enforced, but a reader of the surface had no way to learn that
these two are ours rather than a spelling nobody checked. Under the upgrade
discipline an addition has to be visible as an addition.

**What it costs.** Two names on the surface that no card written for upstream
will call, and that a card written for Iris cannot take elsewhere.

**What would overturn it.** Upstream adding members of the same name with
different semantics, which the `IRIS_OWN` guard would catch as a failure rather
than a silent collision.
